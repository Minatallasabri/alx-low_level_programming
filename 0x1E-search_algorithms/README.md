# Search Algorithms

This repository contains various search algorithms implemented in different programming languages. These algorithms are used to find the presence or position of a specific element in a given collection of data.

## Algorithms Included

1. Linear Search: A simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the collection until a match is found.

2. Binary Search: A more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted collections by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

3. Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

4. Breadth-First Search (BFS): Another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order.


 a search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.

Although search engines use search algorithms, they belong to the study of information retrieval, not algorithmics.

The appropriate search algorithm to use often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Search algorithms can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed database structures, such as search trees, hash maps, and database indexes.

Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms: linear, binary, and hashing. Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion. Binary, or half-interval, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order. Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures by using numerical keys.Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.

Algorithms are often evaluated by their computational complexity, or maximum theoretical run time. Binary search functions, for example, have a maximum complexity of O(log n), or logarithmic time. In simple terms, the maximum number of operations needed to find the search target is a logarithmic function of the size of the search space.
