# Search Algorithms

This repository contains various search algorithms implemented in different programming languages. These algorithms are used to find the presence or position of a specific element in a given collection of data.

## Algorithms Included

1. Linear Search: A simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the collection until a match is found.

2. Binary Search: A more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted collections by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

3. Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

4. Breadth-First Search (BFS): Another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order.
